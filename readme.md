## Protocols

> A survey of protocols being used in the wild.

### Tunneling protocols

- [OpenVPN](http://example.com)
- [WireGuard](http://example.com)

### Fully Obfuscated Protocols

- [Shadowsocks](http://example.com)
- [obfs4](http://example.com)
- [List item](http://example.com)

### Pluggable Transports

- [Pluggable Transport Specification](https://spec.torproject.org/pt-spec/)

## Tools

> Circumvention solutions, or tools that incorporate some form of circumvention.

### Provisioning

- [Outline Server](https://github.com/Jigsaw-Code/outline-server) An Outline server runs instances of Shadowsocks proxies and provides an API used by the Outline Manager application.

### Clients

- [AmneziaVPN](https://github.com/amnezia-vpn/amnezia-client) Amnezia is an
open-source VPN client, with a key feature that enables you to deploy your
own VPN server. It uses the OpenVPN, WireGuard, Shadowsocks, IKev2 and Cloak
protocols. 
- [psiphon](https://github.com/Psiphon-Inc/psiphon)
- [warp-plus](https://github.com/bepass-org/warp-plus) Warp-Plus is an
- open-source implementation of Cloudflare's Warp, enhanced with Psiphon
- integration for circumventing censorship. This project aims to provide a
- robust and cross-platform VPN solution that can use psiphon on top of warp
- and warp-in-warp for changing the user virtual nat location.

## Libraries

> Libraries and toolkits to build your own tools.

### Go

- [bepass][https://github.com/bepass-org/bepass] Bepass is an advanced tool designed to bypass Iran's Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) system using a TLS client hello splitting attack. It also enables the deployment of a VLESS-like proxy on Cloudflare Workers.
- [cloak](https://github.com/cbeuw/Cloak) A pluggable transport.
- [dnstt](https://www.bamsoftware.com/git/dnstt.git/) Userspace DNS tunnel with support for DoH and DoT
- [gluetun vpn client](https://github.com/qdm12/gluetun) Dockerized, multi-provider VPN.
- [gost](https://github.com/ginuerzh/gost) Go Simple Tunnel is a polyglot multi-purpose proxy that speaks differen obfuscation protocols. Has cool features like dynamic service configuration.
- [outline SDK](https://github.com/Jigsaw-Code/outline-sdk) A library to add network-level interference protection to existing apps.
- [snowflake](https://github.com/keroserene/snowflake) Pluggable Transport using WebRTC, inspired by Flashproxy.
- [swgp-go](https://github.com/database64128/swgp-go) üêâ Simple WireGuard proxy with minimal overhead for WireGuard traffic.
- [v2ray-core](https://github.com/v2fly/v2ray-core) 
- [water](https://github.com/gaukas/water) W.A.T.E.R.: WebAssembly Transport Executables Runtime

### Python

- [DPYProxy](https://github.com/UPB-SysSec/DPYProxy) A python proxy that implements DPI evasion mechanisms. Currently, TLS record fragmentation and TCP Fragmentation are implemented.
- [geneva](https://github.com/Kkevsterrr/geneva) automated censorship evasion for the client-side and server-side.

### Rust

- [arti](https://tpo.pages.torproject.net/core/arti/) Tor, in rust.
- [proteus](https://github.com/unblockable/proteus) Programmable Protocols for Censorship Circumvention.
